# voice_recorder

This is an example using the package 'flutter sound'.
As a beginner of programming, I found flutter sound package doesn't have lots of examples though it's very awesome and easy to use.
So I've tried to make an example for you to refer to when you introduce flutter sound to your projects.
As I've written above, I'm not only a beginner of flutter, but of programming.
So you'll find its code is rather hard to read, even impossible to understand.
I apologize to you for my unskillful coding in advance.
And I must thank @Canardoux for making and sharing this incredible package.
