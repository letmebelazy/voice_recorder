# voice_recorder

This is an example using the package 'flutter sound'.<br>
As a beginner of programming, I found flutter sound package doesn't have lots of examples though it's very awesome and easy to use.<br>
So I've tried to make an example for you to refer to when you introduce flutter sound to your projects.<br>
As I've written above, I'm not only a beginner of flutter, but of programming.<br>
So you'll find its code is rather hard to read, even impossible to understand.<br>
I apologize to you for my unskillful coding in advance.<br>
And I must thank @Canardoux for making and sharing this incredible package.<br>
